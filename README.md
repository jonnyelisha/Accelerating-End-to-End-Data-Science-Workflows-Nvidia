#RAPIDS Accelerated Data Science Workflows

Overview
This repository demonstrates how to build and execute end-to-end GPU-accelerated data science workflows using the RAPIDS suite of libraries. By leveraging GPU acceleration, these workflows enable faster data exploration, iteration, and production readiness.

Key Technologies:
cuDF: For GPU-accelerated data manipulation and feature extraction.
cuML: A library for GPU-accelerated machine learning algorithms (KNN, DBSCAN, Logistic Regression).
cuGraph: For performing GPU-accelerated graph analytics (e.g., single-source shortest path).
XGBoost: GPU-accelerated gradient boosting for fast, scalable machine learning.
cuXFilter: GPU-powered data visualization.
Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this course, you'll be able to:
